# Video-Games-Sales-Future

For this project, I performed Data Preprocessing, Cleaning, and Visualization. With the help of Data Visualization, I have determind which games and genres had the highest global sales so far. 

Data Mining algorithms I used are Random Forest (Categorical), Multiple Linear Regression (Numeric), and K-Means Cluster (Numeric). With the help of these algorithms, I have predicted the future of video games sales and calculated the accuracy of each model. 

Based on Data Visualization and algorithm implementations, I realized that Action games had the most global sales in the past, and will have the highest sales in the future. I also found out that games that do not have any user & critical scores, will have less global sales. Thus, user and critic scores are the important features for the model.
